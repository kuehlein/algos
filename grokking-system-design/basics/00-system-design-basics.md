---

### Whenever we are designing a large system, we need to consider a few things:

1. What are the different architectural pieces that can be used?
2. How do these pieces work with each other?
3. How can we best utilize these pieces: what are the right tradeoffs?

**Do not** invest in scaling before it is necessary *generally speaking*

*but...*

Some forethought into the design can save valuable time and resources in the future.
